//!Run-length encoding of a list (direct solution). (medium)
//!
//!Implement the so-called run-length encoding data compression method directly.
//! I.e. don't explicitly create the sublists containing the duplicates, as in
//! problem "Pack consecutive duplicates of list elements into sublists", but
//! only count them. As in problem "Modified run-length encoding", simplify the
//! result list by replacing the singleton lists (1 X) by X.
// same with p11 ?
